I have created Prolog standardization discussion forums at:

<http://prolog.logtalk.org/>

The forums are open to all people willing to contribute to improve the current Prolog standards and standardization proposals. 

My hope is that by making the current standardization process more open and public we can attract more interested parties and more feedback on the current proposals. The current model of using mailing lists is too closed and restricted and only a few people are able to attend and participate in the official ISO meetings. 

In the forums you will find links to the current standardization proposals and to some of the earlier mailing list discussions. A wiki is also planned in the near future to allow forum discussions to be summarized, providing a more suitable collaboration tool to get the text of the final standardization proposals in shape for balloting.
