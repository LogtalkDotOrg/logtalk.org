I'm co-organizing, together with Ulrich Neumerkel, an [ICLP'09](http://www.ist.unomaha.edu/iclp2009/) workshop on software engineering:

[https://logtalk.org/workshops/clpse2009/](https://logtalk.org/workshops/clpse2009/)

If you're working in any topic related to software engineering in the context of logic programming applications or developing a sizable logic programming application consider submitting your work to the 4th International Workshop on (Constraint) Logic Programming and Software Engineering. See the URL above for details.
