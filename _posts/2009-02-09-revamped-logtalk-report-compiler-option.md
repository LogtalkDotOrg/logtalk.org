The next Logtalk stable release will feature a revamped `report` compiler option. A new option value, `warnings`, reduces compilation reporting to warnings. If your Logtalk application comprises a large number of source files, defining a large number of entities, I suspect that you will appreciate the simplified compilation reports. If you don't want to wait for the next stable release, the new `warnings` option is already available in the current development version.
