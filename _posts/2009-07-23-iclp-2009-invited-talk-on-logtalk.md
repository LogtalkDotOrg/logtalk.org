My thanks to Patricia Hill and David S. Warren for the invitation. A special thanks for all of you that attended the invited talk. Hope you enjoyed it. I had a great time at Pasadena, meeting old friends and making new ones. The only puzzling thing was people complains about the temperature in theÂ conference rooms, which I found quite comfortable. But that was just me ;-) There are some interesting news from the ISO Prolog standardization meeting but that's a topic for another post.
