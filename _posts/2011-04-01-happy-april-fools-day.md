This just in: WG17 changes course

Tired of being cursed by all for standardization problems and mishaps, the next ISO Prolog Core standard revision will mandate:

- Forward-chaining inference mechanism. Stated reason: you cannot move Prolog forward doing backward reasoning.

- Replacement of stream-based input/output with revamped, time-proved, Edinburgh-style input/output. Highlights: `see_what/1` and `told_you_so/0` built-in predicates for DWIM user-friendly semantics.

- New character escape `0'\q` unexpectedly quits Prolog for those embarrassing programming moments.

- Due to all controversy regarding `char_conversion/2`, from now on all standards will be published in Esperanto.

- Attempting printing of cyclic terms will endlessly print the lyrics of "99 bottles of beer on the wall".

- New operator class `yfy` for decomposing operands.

- Singleton variable report by `read_term/3` is deprecated as it's not politically correct to complain about a variable choice of life-style. In addition, for privacy reasons, the `variable_names/1` option is also deprecated.

- New value for the `unknown` flag, `true`, provides a sharp decrease on the number of "`no`"s reported by Prolog interpreters. Specially relevant in educational environments, it will hopefully contribute to make the language more attractive to students.

- Database built-in predicates are enhanced with an optional argument for cloud computing. Handy for hiding your dirty programming tricks.

- The de facto standard `freeze/2` predicate is added to the standard but with an extra argument that allows the user to specify a time-out value, freeing the goal to fulfill its destiny.

- Further details are still being worked out but stay tuned.

Hoping that no one here is humor-impaired, Happy April Fools' Day :-)
