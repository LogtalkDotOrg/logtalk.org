I have been so busy in the last weeks that I simply overlooked the Logtalk 10th anniversary a few days ago! The development of Logtalk 2.x started in January 1998, and the first stable version was released in February 9, 1999. Ten years later, developing Logtalk is still fun and rewarding, thanks to all the contributions from users and Prolog implementors. Keep your feature requests and bug reports coming! Work in the next stable version is progressing nicely and, with your help, I plan to keep developing and improving Logtalk for the next ten years. If I can make a wish: don't be shy about what you're doing with Logtalk. Stop by the [Logtalk forums](http://forums.logtalk.org/), talk a bit about your applications, and share your development experience.
