General
</div>

<blockquote>
<p class="name">
<a name="general-1"></a><em>Why are all versions of Logtalk numbered 2.x or 3.x?</em>
</p>
<p>
The numbers "2" and "3" in the Logtalk version string refers to, respectively, the second and the third generations of the Logtalk language. Development of Logtalk 2 started on January 1998, with the first alpha release for registered users on July and the first public beta on October. The first stable version of Logtalk 2 was released on February 9, 1999. Development of Logtalk 3 started on April 2012, with the first public alpha released on August 21, 2012. The first stable version of Logtalk 3 was released on January 7, 2015.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="name">
<a name="general-2"></a><em>Why do I need a Prolog compiler to use Logtalk?</em>
</p>
<p>
Currently, the Logtalk language is implemented as a Prolog extension instead of as a standalone compiler. Compilation of Logtalk source files is performed in two steps. First, the Logtalk compiler converts a source file to a Prolog file. Second, the chosen Prolog compiler is called by Logtalk to compile the intermediate Prolog file generated on the first step. The implementation of Logtalk as a Prolog extension allows users to use Logtalk together with features only available on specific Prolog compilers.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="name">
<a name="general-3"></a><em>Is the Logtalk implementation based on Prolog modules?</em>
</p>
<p>
No. Logtalk is (currently) implemented is plain Prolog code. Only a few Prolog compilers include a module system, with several compatibility problems between them. Moreover, the current ISO Prolog standard for modules is next to worthless and is ignored by most of the Prolog community. Nevertheless, the Logtalk compiler is able to compile simple modules (using a common subset of module directives) as objects for backward-compatibility with existing code (see the <a href="manuals/userman/migration.html">Prolog integration and migration guide</a> for details).
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="name">
<a name="general-4"></a><em>Does the Logtalk implementation use term-expansion?</em>
</p>
<p>
No. Term-expansion mechanisms are not standard and are not available in all supported Prolog compilers.
</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="subtopictitle">
Compatibility
</div>

<blockquote>
<p class="name">
<a name="compatibility-1"></a><em>Can I use constraint-based packages with Logtalk?</em>
</p>
<p>
Usually, yes. Some constraint-based packages may define operators which clash with the ones defined by Logtalk. In these cases, compatibility with Logtalk depends on the constraint-based packages providing an alternative for accessing the functionality provided by those operators. When the constraint solver is encapsulated using a Prolog module, a possible workaround is to use explicit module qualification, encapsulating the call using the <code>{}/1</code> Logtalk control construct (thus bypassing the Logtalk compiler).
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="name">
<a name="compatibility-2"></a><em>Can I use Logtalk objects and Prolog modules at the same time?</em>
</p>
<p>
Yes. In order to call a module predicate from within an object (or category) you may use a <code>use_module/2</code> directive or use explicit module qualification (possibly wrapping the call using the Logtalk control construct <code>{}/1</code> that allows bypassing of the Logtalk compiler when compiling a predicate call). Logtalk also allows modules to be compiled as objects (see the <a href="manuals/userman/migration.html">Prolog integration and migration guide</a> for details).
</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="subtopictitle">
Installation
</div>

<blockquote>
<p class="name">
<a name="installation-1"></a><em>The integration scripts/shortcuts are not working!</em>
</p>
<p>
Check that the <code>LOGTALKHOME</code> and <code>LOGTALKUSER</code> environment variables are defined, that the Logtalk user folder is available on the location pointed by <code>LOGTALKUSER</code> (you can create this folder by running the shell script <code>cplgtdirs</code>), and that the Prolog compilers that you want to use are supported and available from the system path. If the problem persists, run the shell script that creates the integration script or shortcut manually and check for any error message or additional instructions. For some Prolog compilers such as XSB and Ciao, the first call of the integration script or shortcut must be made by an administrator user. If you are using Windows, make sure that any anti-virus or other security software that you might have installed is not silently blocking some of the installer tasks.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="name">
<a name="installation-2"></a><em>I get some errors while starting up Logtalk after upgrading to the latest version!</em>
</p>
<p>
Changes in the Logtalk compiler between releases may render Prolog config files from older versions incompatible with new ones. You may need to update your local Logtalk user files by running e.g. the <code>logtalk_user_setup</code> shell script. Check the <code>UPGRADING.md</code> file on the root of the Logtalk installation directory and the release notes for any incompatible changes to the config files.
</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="subtopictitle">
Portability
</div>

<blockquote>
<p class="name">
<a name="portability-1"></a><em>Are my Logtalk applications portable across Prolog compilers?</em>
</p>
<p>
Yes, as long you don't use built-in predicates or special features only available on some Prolog compilers. There is a compiler flag (<code>portability</code>) that you can set to instruct Logtalk to print a warning for each call in your code of non-ISO Prolog standard built-in predicates. In addition, it is advisable that you constrain, if possible, the use of platform or compiler dependent code to a small number of objects with clearly defined protocols. You may also use Logtalk support for conditional compilation to compile different entity or predicate definitions depending on the back-end Prolog compiler being used.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="name">
<a name="portability-2"></a><em>Are my Logtalk applications portable across operating systems?</em>
</p>
<p>
Yes. However, you may need to change the end-of-lines characters of your source files to match the ones on the target operating system and the expectations of your Prolog compiler. Some Prolog compilers silently fail to compile source files with the wrong end-of-lines characters.
</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="subtopictitle">
Programming
</div>

<blockquote>
<p class="name">
<a name="programming-1"></a><em>Should I use prototypes or classes in my application?</em>
</p>
<p>
Prototypes and classes provide different forms of code reuse. A prototype encapsulates code that can be used by itself and by its descendent prototypes. A class encapsulates code to be used by its descendent instances. Prototypes provide the best replacement to the use of modules as encapsulation units, avoiding the need to instantiate a class in order to access its code.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="name">
<a name="programming-2"></a><em>Can I use both classes and prototypes in the same application?</em>
</p>
<p>
Yes. In addition, you may freely exchange messages between prototypes, classes, and instances.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="name">
<a name="programming-3"></a><em>Can I mix classes and prototypes in the same hierarchy?</em>
</p>
<p>
No. However, you may define as many hierarchies of prototypes and classes as needed by your application.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="name">
<a name="programming-4"></a><em>Can I use a protocol or a category with both prototypes and classes?</em>
</p>
<p>
Yes. A protocol may be implemented by both prototypes and classes in the same application. Likewise, a category may be imported by both prototypes and classes in the same application.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="name">
<a name="programming-5"></a><em>What support is provided in Logtalk for defining and using components?</em>
</p>
<p>
Logtalk supports component-based programming (since its inception on January, 1998), by using <em>categories</em> (which are first-class entities like objects and protocols). Logtalk categories can be used with both classes and prototypes and are inspired on the Smalltalk-80 (documentation-only) concept of method categories and on Objective-C categories, hence the name. For more information, please consult the <a href="documentation.html">documentation</a> and the examples provided with the system.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="name">
<a name="programming-6"></a><em>What support is provided in Logtalk for reflective programming?</em>
</p>
<p>
Logtalk supports meta-classes, behavioral reflection through the use of event-driven programming, and structural reflection through the use of a set of built-in predicates and built-in methods which allow us to query the system about existing entities, entity relations, and entity predicates.
</p>

<div class="subtopictitle">
Troubleshooting
</div>

<blockquote>
<p class="name">
<a name="troubleshooting-1"></a><em>Using compiler options on calls to the Logtalk compiling and loading predicates do not work!</em>
</p>
<p>
Using compiler options on calls to the Logtalk <code>logtalk_compile/2</code> and <code>logtalk_load/2</code> built-in predicates only apply the file being compiled. If the first argument is a <em>loader</em> file, the compiler options will only be used in the compilation of the loader file itself, not in the compilation of the files loaded by the loader file. The solution is to edit the loader file and add the compiler options to the calls that compile/load the individual files.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="name">
<a name="troubleshooting-2"></a><em>Gecko-based browsers (e.g. Firefox) show non-rendered HTML entities when browsing XML documenting files!</em>
</p>
<p>
Using Gecko-based browsers (e.g. Firefox) show non-rendered HTML entities (e.g. <code>&amp;ndash;</code>) when browsing XML documenting files after running the <code>lgt2xml</code> shell script in the directory containing the XML documenting files. This is a consequence of the lack of support for the <code>disable-output-escaping</code> attribute in the browser XSLT processor. The workaround is to use other browser (e.g. Safari or Opera) or to use instead the <code>lgt2html</code> shell script in the directory containing the XML documenting files to convert them to (X)HTML files for browsing.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="name">
<a name="troubleshooting-3"></a><em>Compiling a source file results in errors or warnings but the Logtalk compiler reports a successful compilation with zero errors and zero warnings!</em>
</p>
This may happen when your Prolog compiler implementation of the ISO Prolog standard <code>write_canonical/2</code> built-in predicate is buggy and writes terms that cannot be read back when consulting the intermediate Prolog files generated by the Logtalk compiler. Often, syntax errors found when consulting result in error messages but not in exceptions as the Prolog compiler tries to continue the compilation despite the problems found. As the Logtalk compiler relies on the exception mechanisms to catch compilation problems, it may report zero errors and zero warnings despite the error messages. Send a bug report to the Prolog compiler developers asking them to fix the <code>write_canonical/2</code> buggy implementation.

Usability
</div>

<blockquote>
<p class="name">
<a name="usability-1"></a><em>Is there a shortcut for compiling and loading source files?</em>
</p>
<p>
Yes. With most back-end Prolog compilers, you can use <code>{File}</code> as a shortcut for <code>logtalk_load(File)</code>. For compiling and loading multiple files simply use <code>{File1, File2, ...}</code>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="name">
<a name="usability-2"></a><em>Is there an equivalent directive to the <code>ensure_loaded/1</code> Prolog directive?</em>
</p>
<p>
You can use the goal <code>logtalk_load(File, [reload(skip)])</code> to ensure that <code>File</code> is only loaded once.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="name">
<a name="usability-3"></a><em>Are there shortcuts for the <em>make</em> functionality?</em>
</p>
<p>
Yes. With most back-end Prolog compilers, you can use <code>{*}</code> as a shortcut for <code>logtalk_make(all)</code> to reload all files modified since last compiled and loaded, <code>{!}</code> as a shortcut for <code>logtalk_make(clean)</code> to delete all intermediate Prolog files generated by the compilation of Logtalk source files, <code>{?}</code> as a shortcut for <code>logtalk_make(missing)</code> to list missing entities and predicates, and <code>{@}</code> as a shortcut for <code>logtalk_make(circular)</code> to list circular references.
</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="subtopictitle">
Deployment
</div>

<blockquote>
<p class="name">
<a name="deployment-1"></a><em>Can I create standalone applications with Logtalk?</em>
</p>
<p>
It depends on the Prolog compiler that you use to run Logtalk. Assuming that your Prolog compiler supports the creation of standalone executables, your application must include the config file for your compiler and the Logtalk compiler and runtime.

<div class="subtopictitle">
Performance
</div>

<blockquote>
<p class="name">
<a name="performance-1"></a><em>Is Logtalk implemented as a meta-interpreter?</em>
</p>
<p>
No. Objects and their encapsulated predicates are compiled, not meta-interpreted. In particular, inheritance relations are pre-compiled for improved performance. Moreover, no meta-interpreter is used even for objects compiled in debug mode.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="name">
<a name="performance-2"></a><em>What kind of code Logtalk generates when compiling objects? Dynamic code? Static code?</em>
</p>
<p>
Static objects are compiled to static code. Static objects containing dynamic predicates are also compiled to static code, except, of course, for the dynamic predicates themselves. Dynamic objects are necessarily compiled to dynamic code. As in Prolog programming, for best performance, dynamic object predicates and dynamic objects should only be used when truly needed.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="name">
<a name="performance-3"></a><em>How about message-sending performance? Does Logtalk use static binding or dynamic binding?</em>
</p>
<p>
Logtalk supports both static binding and dynamic binding. When static binding is not possible, Logtalk uses dynamic binding coupled with a caching mechanism that avoids repeated lookups of predicate declarations and predicate definitions. This is a solution common to other programming languages supporting dynamic binding. Message lookups are automatically cached the first time a message is sent. Cache entries are automatically removed when loading entities or using Logtalk dynamic features that invalidate the cached lookups. Whenever static binding is used, message sending performance is essentially the same as a predicate call in plain Prolog. Performance of dynamic binding when lookups are cached is close to the performance that would be achieved with static binding.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="name">
<a name="performance-4"></a><em>Which Prolog-dependent factors are most crucial for good Logtalk performance?</em>
</p>
<p>
Logtalk compiles objects assuming first-argument indexing for static code. First-argument indexing of dynamic code, when available, helps improving performance due to the automatic caching of method lookups and the necessary use of book-keeping tables by the runtime engine (this is specially important when using event-driven programming). Dynamic objects and static objects containing dynamic predicates also benefit from first-argument indexing of dynamic predicates. In addition, message processing may imply two meta-calls (in order to verify if a message is valid and to translate between the message term and its internal representation). Therefore, good Prolog performance on meta-calls translates to improved message processing performance.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="name">
<a name="performance-5"></a><em>How does Logtalk performance compares with plain Prolog and with Prolog modules?</em>
</p>
<p>
Plain Prolog, Prolog modules, and Logtalk objects provide different trade-offs between performance and features. In general, for a given predicate definition, the best performance will be attained using plain Prolog, second will be Prolog modules (assuming no explicitly qualified calls are used), and finally Logtalk objects. Whenever static binding is used, the performance of Logtalk is equal or close to that of plain Prolog (depending on the Prolog virtual machine implementation and compiler optimizations). You can find <a href="performance.html">here</a> some simple benchmark tests using some popular Prolog compilers.
