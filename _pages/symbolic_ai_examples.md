The Logtalk [distribution](download.html) includes some symbolic AI examples, most of them adapted from literature and other logic programming systems (see the example/port notes for credits). These include:

## Neuro-symbolic

* [`ncl`](https://github.com/LogtalkDotOrg/logtalk3/tree/master/examples/ncl) - Net-Clause Language examples

## Expert systems

* [`birds`](https://github.com/LogtalkDotOrg/logtalk3/tree/master/examples/birds) - Bird identification expert system
* [`faults`](https://github.com/LogtalkDotOrg/logtalk3/tree/master/examples/lpa/faults) - Expert system for automobile fault diagnosis

## Searching

* [`searching`](https://github.com/LogtalkDotOrg/logtalk3/tree/master/examples/searching) - State-space blind and heuristic search methods

## Machine Learning

* [`metagol`](https://github.com/LogtalkDotOrg/logtalk3/tree/master/ports/metagol) - Port of the Metagol Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) system

## Reasoning

* [`many_worlds`](https://github.com/LogtalkDotOrg/logtalk3/tree/master/examples/design_patterns/ai/many_worlds) - Design pattern for reasoning about different worlds, where a world can be e.g. a dataset, a knowledge base, a set of examples
