Logtalk is a *declarative object-oriented logic programming language*
that extends and leverages the Prolog language with modern code
encapsulation and code reuse mechanisms while also providing improved
predicate semantics.

Implemented as a trans-compiler in highly portable, extensively tested, and
well documented code, it can use most modern and standards compliant Prolog
implementations as a backend compiler.

As a multi-paradigm language, it includes support for modules,
prototypes, classes, protocols (interfaces), categories (components and
hot patching), event-driven programming, and high-level multi-threading
programming. Distributed under a commercial friendly license, it
includes full documentation, portable libraries, portable developer
tools, and a large number of programming examples to help get you
started.
