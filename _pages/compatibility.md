Logtalk runs on any operating-system with a standards compliant modern
Prolog compiler. The interface between Logtalk and a specific backend
Prolog compiler is accomplished using a small adapter file. The Logtalk
distribution includes adapter files for all supported Prolog compilers:

-   [B-Prolog 7.8 or later versions](http://www.picat-lang.org/bprolog/)
-   [CxProlog 0.98.1 or later
    versions](http://ctp.di.fct.unl.pt/~amd/cxprolog/)
-   [ECLiPSe 6.1\#143 or later versions](http://eclipseclp.org/)
-   [GNU Prolog 1.4.5 or later versions](http://www.gprolog.org/)
-   [JIProlog 4.1.6.1 or later versions](http://www.jiprolog.com/)
-   [Lean Prolog 4.5.7 or later
    versions](http://www.cse.unt.edu/~tarau/) *(experimental)*
-   [Qu-Prolog 9.7 or later
    versions](http://www.itee.uq.edu.au/~pjr/HomePages/QuPrologHome.html)
-   [Quintus Prolog 3.3\~3.5](https://quintus.sics.se) *(experimental)*
-   [SICStus Prolog 4.1.0 or later versions](https://sicstus.sics.se)
-   [SWI Prolog 6.6.0 or later versions](http://www.swi-prolog.org/)
-   [XSB 3.8.0 or later versions](http://xsb.sourceforge.net/)
-   [YAP 6.3.4 or later versions](http://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/~vsc/Yap/)

Legacy Logtalk versions (2.x) provide support for some other Prolog
compilers, which are no longer supported due to lack of compliance with
official and de facto standards.
