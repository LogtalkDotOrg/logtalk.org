such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation
against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within
the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then
any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work
shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.</p>

informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may
add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You
distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the
Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be
construed as modifying the License.\
\
You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for
use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any
such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction,
and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions
stated in this License.</li>

required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent
acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You
for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or
consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this
License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but
not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer
failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or
losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of
such damages.</p>

<p><strong>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability</strong>. While redistributing
the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and
charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other
liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License.
However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own

Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each
Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted
against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty
or additional liability.</p>
